                      This is the type of meat that is solely made from plants but has the texture, taste, smell and even the sizzle of real animal based meat.
 This meat has fooled almost everyone including one of the richest man in the world, Bill Gate. 
 Plant based meat emits 30 percent to 90 percent less greenhouse gases than normal meat.
 Plant based meat is lower in calories, fat and cholesterol than conventional meat.
 The leading vegan meat producing companies are Ovego, Good Dot, Urban Platter and Veggie champ.
Fibres can aid with blood sugar regulation, cholesterol reduction, and making us feel fuller for longer periods of time. Vegan meat contains fibres in a huge amount, making it even further healthier.
 The awareness of plant based meat is almost negligible in India.
